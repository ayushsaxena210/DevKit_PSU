Home_page_heading: HEY its my first project
Home_page_text: "This app will use the Flask app factory pattern with blueprints.\
  \ One blueprint handles the regular routes, which include the index and the protected\
  \ profile page. Another blueprint handles everything auth-related. In a real app,\
  \ you can break down the functionality in any way you like, but the solution covered\
  \ here will work well for this tutorial.\r\n\r\nThis file will have the function\
  \ to create the app, which will initialize the database and register the blueprints.\
  \ At the moment, this will not do much, but it will be needed for the rest of the\
  \ app.\r\n\r\nYou will need to initialize SQLAlchemy, set some configuration values,\
  \ and register the blueprints here:"
